### S: Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one job

>A class should be responsible for only one thing. If a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled. A change to one responsibility results to modification of the other responsibility.

### O: Open-Closed Principle

>Software entities(Classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, not modification.

### L: Liskov Substitution Principle

>A sub-class must be substitutable for its super-class

### I: Interface Segregation Principle

>Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

### D: Dependency Inversion Principle
> Dependency should be on abstractions not concretions
A. High-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
